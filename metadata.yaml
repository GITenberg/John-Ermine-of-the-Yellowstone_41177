description: 'John Ermine of the Yellowstone (1902) is Frederic Remington''s greatest
  literary achievement. A tragic and realistic story about race, identity, love, and
  the frontier is still a favorite of American readers today.<P style=MARGIN: 0in
  0in 0pt> <P style=MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt>John Ermine, known to his Crow tribe as White
  Weasel, must choose between the tribe that became his family and his white heritage.
  Although John sees himself as Native American at heart, he chooses to side with
  his white forbears and serve in the U.S. Army. When the commander''s daughter, Katherine
  Searles, comes to base camp he attempts to connect with and woo her. His failure
  poses the question, can women like Katherine and men like John live in the same
  space? Or is this, tragically, The End of All Things?'
